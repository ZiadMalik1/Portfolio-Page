      "It’s so inspiring to work with and mentor an engineer that exudes so much potential. I had the pleasure of mentoring Ziad for about three months in an internship program and he was an absolute joy to work with. Ziad’s exceptional ability to learn quickly helped his onboarding experience and allowed him fix bugs and work on enhancements in the first week of his internship. Ziad showed great receptivity and resilience in working on a project to develop a new microservice within our platform. I absolutely loved his curiosity to learn and his desire to understand the tools and techniques used to develop, test and ship code to production. Ziad would be a great addition to any team and I see a bright future ahead of him.",
