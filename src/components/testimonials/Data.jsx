      "It’s so inspiring to work with and mentor an engineer that exudes so much potential. I had the pleasure of mentoring Ziad for about three months in an internship program and he was an absolute joy to work with. Ziad’s exceptional ability to learn quickly helped his onboarding experience and allowed him fix bugs and work on enhancements in the first week of his internship. Ziad showed great receptivity and resilience in working on a project to develop a new microservice within our platform. I absolutely loved his curiosity to learn and his desire to understand the tools and techniques used to develop, test and ship code to production. Ziad would be a great addition to any team and I see a bright future ahead of him.",

    "What an energetic and driven young professional. Over the summer of 2022 I worked along side Ziad as a software engineer. From the time we met, Ziad was engaged and all in on every task he was given. Ziad’s ability to problem solve and ask intelligent questions got him working on defects within his first week on the team. He was a sponge and soaked up a lot of information on the software development lifecycle, and was involved deeply in all aspects of development. During his time with the team he built a micro service by himself and created an end to end implementation for how to integrate it with our platform. It was so refreshing to be around him during his internship. Ziad’s naturally curious mind and ability to quickly understand and apply his knowledge in practice will make him an awesome addition to any engineering team. All the best in the future I can’t wait to see where the future takes him!",
